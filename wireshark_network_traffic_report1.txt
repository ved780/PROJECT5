Network Traffic Analysis Report
================================

Date of Capture : [12/08/2025]
Captured Using  : Wireshark
Analyst         : Ved Vyas

Summary
-------
This report summarizes the network traffic captured during the observation period. The data includes packet counts, byte sizes, and protocol distribution.

Protocol Statistics
-------------------
| Protocol       | Packets | % of Total | Bytes   | % of Bytes |
|----------------|---------|------------|---------|------------|
| Ethernet       | 80      | 100.0%     | 1150    | 4.6%       |
| IPv6           | 4       | 5.0%       | 184     | 0.7%       |
| └── ICMPv6     | 4       | 5.0%       | 184     | 0.7%       |
| IPv4           | 76      | 95.0%      | 1520    | 6.1%       |
| ├── UDP        | 12      | 15.0%      | 96      | 0.4%       |
| │ ├── NTP      | 4       | 5.0%       | 192     | 0.8%       |
| │ └── DNS      | 8       | 10.0%      | 679     | 2.7%       |
| └── TCP        | 64      | 80.0%      | 1400    | 5.6%       |
|    └── TLS     | 22      | 27.5%      | 9513    | 38.2%      |

Observations
------------
1. Ethernet traffic accounts for 100% of the captured packets, as expected for a local network environment.
2. IPv4 traffic dominates (95%), with a small proportion (5%) of IPv6 packets observed.
3. TCP is the most prominent transport protocol, comprising 80% of the packets.
4. A significant amount of TLS traffic (38.2% of total bytes) indicates encrypted communications.
5. DNS and NTP traffic are present, typical for name resolution and time synchronization services.

Conclusion
----------
The captured data shows normal operational traffic with no immediate anomalies. High TLS usage suggests secure communications, which is generally a positive indicator for confidentiality.
